# 🔴 Database Connection Issue - Quick Fix

Your Supabase database at `db.stdqhbqpcrcccguaqxuq.supabase.co` is **paused** or unreachable.

## ✅ Solution 1: Wake Up Your Database (FASTEST)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**

   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/stdqhbqpcrcccguaqxuq

2. **Wake the database:**

   - The database auto-pauses after inactivity on free tier
   - Click on "Database" in the left sidebar
   - You should see a message about the database being paused
   - Click **"Resume Database"** or **"Unpause"**
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for it to wake up

3. **Refresh your app:**
   - Go back to http://localhost:3000
   - The dashboard should now load with real data instead of demo data
   - The red error banner will disappear

## ✅ Solution 2: Check Database Status

Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT 1;
```

If it works, your database is active!

## ✅ Solution 3: Verify Connection String

Your current DATABASE_URL should look like:

```
postgresql://postgres:7838LIGHTNINGLORD@db.stdqhbqpcrcccguaqxuq.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

Make sure this is in your `.env` or `.env.local` file.

## 🎯 What's Happening Now:

- ✅ Authentication is working perfectly
- ✅ Dashboard is showing demo data (fallback mode)
- ❌ Real database connection is failing
- ⏸️ Database is likely paused due to inactivity

## 📊 Current Status:

The app is **working correctly** with the fallback system I implemented. You're seeing:

- Demo subjects and data
- Red banner at top warning about database issue
- Full navigation and UI

Once you wake up the database, everything will work with your real data!
