# 🔐 Proper Supabase Authentication Setup

## ✅ **Real Authentication - Each User Gets Their Own Content**

### **📋 Step 1: Get Your Real Supabase Credentials**

1. **Go to your Supabase project:**

   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/stdqhbqpcrcccguaqxuq/settings/api

2. **Copy these values:**
   ```
   Project URL: https://stdqhbqpcrcccguaqxuq.supabase.co
   anon public key: [copy the long JWT token]
   ```

### **🔧 Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. **Add these variables:**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://stdqhbqpcrcccguaqxuq.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = [your real anon key from step 1]
DATABASE_URL = [your postgres connection string]
```

### **🔐 Step 3: Enable Email Authentication in Supabase**

1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/stdqhbqpcrcccguaqxuq/auth/providers
2. **Enable Email provider** (should be enabled by default)
3. **Confirm email is enabled**

### **🚀 Step 4: Deploy and Test**

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
2. **Redeploy on Vercel**
3. **Test the flow:**
   - Sign up with real email → Check email for confirmation
   - Sign in → Get your own isolated study tracker
   - Each user gets their own CS Executive subjects automatically

### **👥 How It Works:**

- **User 1** signs up → Gets their own study tracker with all CS subjects
- **User 2** signs up → Gets their own separate study tracker
- **Each user's data is completely isolated**
- **Progress tracking is per-user**
- **Study history is per-user**

### **✨ Benefits:**

- ✅ Real user accounts with email verification
- ✅ Each user gets isolated content
- ✅ Secure authentication
- ✅ Password reset functionality
- ✅ Email confirmation
- ✅ Automatic subject seeding for new users

**Your girlfriend (and anyone else) can create their own account and have their own private study tracker!** 🎓
